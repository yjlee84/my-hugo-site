We utilize the Difference-in-Differences method to evaluate the effect of universal childcare provision in West Germany. Our results show that the policy was effective in increasing the fertility rate of the native population but not for the non-native, as well as for married mothers but non-married mothers. We provide evidence that childcare provision is more beneficial for mothers with higher opportunity costs in terms of childcare time at home. These findings suggest that future pronatalist policies should carefully consider targeting specific population groups.
